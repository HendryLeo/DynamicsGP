We are using POP User Defined Value to track reporting to external parties. There is a dedicated personel to do the reporting, independent from our warehouse
This reporter will take warehouse Receipt (Saved and posted) and create the report. Once the report is submitted, the Receipt (saved one) must not be changed.

I am adding additional menu to POPInquiryReceivingWindow to open POPUserDefined Winform (has to create winform, because POPUserDefinedInquiry is not editable)
also additional Smartlist that will open POPInquiryReceiving, since the built in Smartlist for PurchasingReceivingTransaction will open saved Receipt to POPReceivingEntry
